            "“gurussākṣāt parabrahma”. Guru means Sadguru and He is Datta. He takes your sins through food and money you offer to him and can get rid of your sins proportionally so that you will be happy and can do sadhana. Shiridi Sai Baba told that the bread offered to Him was their sins.",
            "Escaping from world is not salvation. Liberation from selfishness is the true salvation. You can liberate Yourself from the cycle of deeds by doing one deed, which is the work in My service",
            "Following the path of justice and avoiding path of injustice alone can protect a soul since the constitution of justice is created by Me, God Datta. No other factor like caste, gender, age, religion, race (like human beings, angels etc.,), a specific form of God can protect the soul",
            "Devotion, sacrifice, service, concentration through meditation on one goal and singing devotional songs with tears are growing tremendously day by day! But the basis of all these spiritual efforts is selfishness only, which is aspiration for some selfish fruit!!",
            "If a sin is done and confessed theoretically, only one punishment is given. If You misinterpret Your sin as not sin through Your over-intelligence, double punishment is given. One punishment is for Your sin. The second punishment is for Your misinterpretation or telling a lie that You have not done the sin",
            "In kruta age, all sages were investigating the nature of the unimaginable God.

Then, Atri cried saying ‘obtained’ (Dattā)",

            "Don’t misunderstand that propagation of My spiritual knowledge is service of God and service of other souls. If You analyse deeply, it is only Your service by serving Yourself! By propagation of knowledge heard to others, the knowledge gets more and more assimilated in Yourself leading You in to practice through developed inspiration",
            "If You are not in the path of justice and do injustice, all these four (knowledge, devotion, sacrifice and service) become waste and fall down like a palace built without foundation. Demon Ravana was topper in all these four efforts. But, he was totally ruined due to injustice, which is desire for illegal sex",
            "Angels and demons are in human beings only. I punish demons and rectify them at least for some time. I cannot excuse demons because they realize the sins but do not rectify due to ego. Animals and birds are excused since they can’t realize even if taught. Animals and birds exist separately in different forms. Angels and demons are not seen by You separately since they also exist in human beings",
            "See these four dogs around My feet, which are the Vedas personified. These four represent the four topmost sages: Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara and Sanatsujaata. These Vedas continuously discussed about Me without rest and stand tired with vibrating tongues at My feet indicting their failure to express My original nature, choosing final surrender to My feet!",
            "I am standing taking the cow as My back support indicating that even I am based on the constitution only since the rule maker will follow the rule strictly. The white colour of the cow indicates the purity of justice. This entire world including spiritual aspirants and spiritually ripened is based on justice only",
            "What is justice? and what is injustice? –for this, You need not refer so many books. The definitions of justice and injustice can be given in very simple way. That, which pleases God Datta, is justice. That, which displeases God Datta, is injustice",
            "The contemporary human incarnation appears as per the colour of spectacles on your eyes. Krishna appeared as God for Gopikas. Same Krishna appeared as divine person or son of God to Bhishma, Dharma Raja, Arjuna etc. Same Krishna appeared as servant of God to villagers of Brundavanam. Same Krishna appeared as a devil to Kauravas, Kamsa, Shishupala etc. The behaviour of God is according to the colour of the sight of spectator",
            "Mind, word and action are the three instrumental forms of the spiritual effort or spiritual power (energy). Of course, you can use these three for the sake of essential needs and there is no objection here. But, don’t waste these three for unnecessary luxuries. At least, you divert these three (which are wasted in luxuries) to the work of God",
            "Without tasting the divine nectar, you cannot leave the worldly drinks like coffee because by leaving worldly drinks, divine nectar is not obtained. But, by tasting the divine nectar, worldly drinks drop off by themselves. Hence, what is the use of dropping the worldly drinks by force without tasting the divine nectar, which is a double loss?",
            "In Āyurveda, there are two ways of curing disease: treating the root cause through Nidāna cikitsā or treating the symptoms through Lakṣaṇa cikitsā. Dattā, a specific doctor, always attacks the root cause through True Knowledge medicine, recognizing that unless the root cause is cured, symptoms will continue to reappear",

            "Chaos and tension arise from injustice and sin, both at the individual and universal level. Fear of punishment for sin is necessary for peace, and this must be enforced by governments. However, sinners often escape punishment through the intelligence of advocates and corruption in the courts and police stations",
            "The exhibition of the existence of the unimaginable God, who will punish the sins through His unimaginable power, is essential for establishing justice and peace in this world. Only fear of punishment for sin can bring about this establishment, which is the single leftover solution in a world filled with uncontrollable ambitions",
            "When you are attached to God, the worldly bonds are dropped by themselves without any effort. Forcibly detaching worldly bonds before the ripened state of your devotion to God will be a serious condition in which you will be more fascinated by them. Detachment without attachment to God is not only useless but also impossible",
            "Without tasting the divine nectar, you cannot leave the worldly drinks like coffee because by leaving worldly drinks, divine nectar is not obtained. But, by tasting the divine nectar, worldly drinks drop off by themselves. Hence, what is the use of dropping the worldly drinks by force without tasting the divine nectar, which is a double loss?",
            "Sālokya means that God and devotee are in the same world like Hanuman and Rama or Radha and Krishna are on the same earth. Sāmīpya means that God and devotee are in the same place by becoming closer. Sārūpya means that the devotee tries to look like God. Sāyujya means the devotee becoming very very close to God. Kaivalya is the final step in which God merges with the devotee perfectly to become energetic or human incarnation. These five words indicate the increasing closeness step by step",
            "Mind is interrelated with body. Keep the mind steady and stable without emotions of both happiness and tragedy. Emotion spoils the health. But, emotion regarding God will never harm you and moreover improves your health",
            "Gopikas captured (dhāraṇā) the contemporary human incarnation and attained Goloka, which is higher than the highest fruit (abode of God). It is not possible to capture the energetic incarnation like God Vishnu or God Śiva etc., for human beings through penance. They conquered the repulsion between common human media by surpassing ego and jealousy towards co-human forms. If this essence is understood, the attainment of God called ‘Yoga’ becomes very simple. The fundamental clue in Yoga for humanity is only to conquer ego based jealousy towards human Incarnation",
            "Mantra means a statement, the meaning of which attracts your mind to remember the statement again and again. Such repetition Mantra (mananāt trāyate) itself means that the statement is memorized again and again due to the mental attraction towards its meaning. is called as chanting or Japa. A Bīja akṣara is a just symbolic letter representing an entity like E representing energy, M representing mass, C representing velocity of light etc",
            "You must eat to live and not live to eat! The food must be in limited quantity. If the food is eaten in limited quantity, it is eaten by you (adyate) and if it is eaten more, you will be eaten by it (atti) since it (unlimited food) brings illness to kill you! This is said by the Veda (adyate atti ca bhūtāni tasmāt annaṃ). Only little food is converted into energy. All the rest remaining food brings disease only. More food is eaten due to ambition for self only",
            "Limited food is converted into limited energy. Since the energy is limited, you should not waste your energy in luxuries and in killing the time by useless entertainments. The digestive system is not a machine generating endless energy since the system has limits of work and efficiency. You may be very rich to procure unlimited quantity of food, but, your digestive system has limit in its work-efficiency. Hence, whether you are rich or poor, you have to take care about eating limited food and preserving the limited energy generated",
            "This limited energy should be carefully and precisely used in worldly activities so that as far as possible more and more energy can be available for divine service. Full meal gives sleep. It means that sleep is indicating the full meal. Exactly half of this full meal should be taken so that half vacant stomach is partly filled with water and partly filled with moving gas",
            "The food must be suitable to your body (hitaṃ), limited (mitaṃ) and just cooked (hutaṃ), which alone gives perfect health (hitabhuk mitabhuk hutabhuk). You must rest a little after lunch and walk a little after dinner in the night (katipaya padacaṃkramaṇaḥ). You must never resist urine and motion for a long time (anibaddha mūtra purīṣaḥ). You must have little frequency of sex as far as possible (strīṣu yo jāgarti). All these are tips of health science given by yoga scripture. Health is the real wealth not only in Pravṛtti but also in Nivṛtti",
            "Do not criticize any divine preacher or divine human incarnation in anyway. Think about your level before criticizing others. You should not criticize any mode of worship. Selection of mode of worship depends upon the specific liking of mind, which differs from one person to the other. If somebody is defective in the spiritual path, explain the truth by friendly discussion and don’t enter into hot arguments. Forms of God may be different and paths to reach God also may be different, but, God is only one and the same in every sub-religion or religion",
            "To know the details of the goal is knowledge or Jñāna yoga, which generates attraction towards the goal finally resulting in the practical effort to reach the goal. This is the common concept in spiritual line as well as worldly life. By knowing the details of a city, you are developing attraction to reach the city and finally making the practical effort of journey. Even in the case of Rukmiṇī marrying Krishna, the same sequence can be observed. She heard the details of Krishna from sage Nārada (Jñāna yoga), got attracted to Krishna (Bhakti Yoga) and finally made practical attempts (karma yoga) to reach Krishna to marry Him",
            "Knowledge is the basic life like water for a plant. Devotion is growing strength like the manure for a plant. But plant or karma yoga is the ultimate, that alone is giving fruits. Even an ocean of water and a hill of manure can’t give a single fruit. But, without water, the plant dies immediately and without manure, the plant can’t grow into a tree to give the fruit. Hence, a plant associated with water and manure alone can give the fruit. Jñāna yoga is the water, bhakti yoga is the manure, and karma yoga (both service and sacrifice) is the plant that alone yields fruit",
            "The total salvation from worldly bonds comes only due to total absorption or attachment to God Datta. Such attachment gives you the infinite bliss as the fruit at once. There is no question of any delay in the fruit. Such fortunate grace of God Datta happens without any spiritual effort, and it happens generally in Satsanga",
            "The sacrifice of knowledge (Jñāna Yajña) is very much liked by God as said in the Gita (Jñāna Yajñena tenāham…). God is very much pleased by propagating the right knowledge in spiritual path than in materialistic path like knowledge of science. The reason is that the spiritual field is eternal and very much important for the soul. The Gita says that there is nothing equal to knowledge to purify the soul (Na hi jñānena sadṛśam) and that you can smash all the past sins through knowledge (Sarvaṁ Jñāna-plavenaiva)",
            "We do not know when this life ends because every day is an extension given by God. Ignorant people think that longevity of a human being is fixed. It is not correct. Longevity can be reduced or extended by God based on His observation about the progress of that soul in spiritual path",
            "Even if you sing on God with very sweet voice, God is not pleased if you are aspiring for some fruit in return. Even if you sing with very harsh voice, if your song has no background of any aspiration in return, God is highly pleased. Your intention is important and not the merit of the mode of worship",
            "Language in which you pray is not at all important. God knows all the languages of this world. Some people in Hinduism feel that praying in Sanskrit Language is great. Such feeling is totally wrong because God knows all the languages. God gives more importance to your feeling, which is the meaning of your prayer",
            "The word karma (work) in spiritual knowledge means only your practical sacrifice of service and fruit to God and not the general worldly work.",
            "Spiritual knowledge means only the subject confined to God and not in any way to the world. Hence, sacrifice of work and its fruit are confined to the spiritual field (Nivṛtti) only and not to worldly life (Pravṛtti). Niṣkāma Karma Yoga or free service without any fruit in return preached by the Gita is limited to God only since the word Yoga means the association with God. That should not be extended to the Worldly life.",
            "Spiritual knowledge means only the subject confined to God and not in any way to the world. Hence, sacrifice of work and its fruit are confined to the spiritual field (Nivṛtti) only and not to worldly life (Pravṛtti). Niṣkāma Karma Yoga or free service without any fruit in return preached by the Gita is limited to God only since the word Yoga means the association with God. That should not be extended to the Worldly life",
            "You will be astonished to see the topmost Lord Datta appearing always as the lowest beggar. You must learn from such vision that you should lower yourself as you ascend up.",
            "Arjuna asked the Lord for the reason that forces every soul to do the sin in practical situation. The Lord said that the wrong knowledge very strongly impressed on the mind of the soul for several births is the reason and the only solution for this is an equivalent impression of correct knowledge that destroys the past impressions, which are the six vices. A diamond alone can cut another diamond. After hearing true knowledge (Śravaṇa), it should be memorized (Manana) continuously through the propagation till it becomes very strong decision (Nididhyāsa).",
            "The white swan (Haṃsa), the white eagle (Garuḍa) and the white bull (Nandī) are the three vehicles of three forms of God indicate the Sattvaṃ (knowledge). The swan separates milk (good) and water (bad). The eagle kills serpents indicating killing the bad sinful thoughts. The bull eats only vegetarian food which is grass only, indicating that finally the devotee should accept only the path of non-violence.",
            "A saint spends all the energy to spiritual line only avoiding family and even earning for food. The duty of a saint is propagation of spiritual knowledge to the entire humanity. Hence, it is the duty of house-holders to give food to saints, which is very holy called as ‘Bhikṣā’. The identification of a saint is the holy spiritual knowledge propagated by him/her and not the external saffron cloth. Saffron color stands for maturity as you find in ripened fruit, which should be seen in the knowledge and not in the cloth.",
            "If you have the worldly responsibilities to be fulfilled, your activity should be 1) To spend energy for responsibilities, 2) You must take the stipulated rest and 3) Worship God. Worship should not be confined to mere theoretical devotion like recitation of prayers, singing songs etc., but, should be mainly to arrive at right conclusions through spiritual knowledge and to do practical devotion like sacrifice and service with pure theoretical devotion in heart.",
            "\"Stop Thinking \n" +
                    "Start Chanting\"",
            "“Worship without aspiration for any fruit in return from God” is the essence and life of the entire spiritual knowledge.",
            "A real preacher always criticizes you showing you the steps you have to climb further and never praises you seeing the back steps already climbed by you. You must always look forward and should not look backward to get ego.",
            "It is sufficient to work for some limited time to earn for the minimum needs like food, drink etc. In spite of such possibility, if one works all the time to earn just money only, such soul will be born as animal or bird, which has to put efforts all the time just to earn food. If a soul concentrates on God at least for some time, there is a possibility of human rebirth.",
            "The soul earning all the time doesn’t know that these earnings can’t help it in the upper world. The soul earns more and more for its personal family, which also does not help it in the upper world. Excess of money spoils the family members also. The family doesn’t even recognize you there.",
            "Anger in one sense can be the way to God. Such anger should be based on excess of love like the case of Satyabhama frequently becoming angry with the Lord. The anger of demons is in different angle based on hatred to God. Such anger can’t lead the soul to God.",
            "The enjoyment of fruit of a good deed encourages the soul in its attitude. The enjoyment of fruit of a bad deed discourages the soul in its attitude, but, the bad attitude never vanishes by the punishment. Since the force of bad attitude is reduced by the punishment, the society is benefited at least temporarily. The attitude of bad deed will vanish only by the divine spiritual knowledge.",
            "Hanuman used Himself as a servant in the service of Lord Rama and the benefit of all His service went to the Lord only by getting back Sita. Hanuman is not benefited in any way since He did all the service without aspiration of any personal fruit in return. Hence, Hanuman is worshipped as God and several temples for Hanuman are seen.",
            "Knowledge gives all the details regarding God. Devotion gives the highest fascination for God. Action gives practical service with sacrifice to God. Yoga gives the talent in preserving the energy, time and wealth to be used for God. All these four are the foundation pillars of spiritual knowledge.",
            "Avadhūta means resisting the entry of worldly knowledge in to your brain like virus and hence it is thrown away (Avadhūta means thrown away) by force so that you are not dragged back in to the world again. Without doing this and becoming naked to be called as Avadhuta is climax of foolishness!",
            "Escaping from world is not salvation. Liberation from selfishness is the true salvation. You can liberate Yourself from the cycle of deeds by doing one deed, which is the work in My service.",
            "Control emotions because due to emotions lot of energy is consumed. Hence, try to be always in a balanced state. This advice is about the world and not about God. Whatever energy is lost in the emotions for God, double of it is given by God immediately. I have asked you to save the energy by controlling worldly emotions only for spending it emotions for God.",
            "Giving food in your presence to a hungry soul (Annadaanam) is the best since none can misuse as in the case of money offering. The receiver of food must be old or child or disabled or diseased. You must donate work for earning to a poor person, who is young and healthy. Apart from food and work, you must give shelter, cloths and medicines for diseases. All this is called as beggar home. You must start your sacrifice from the bottom most level and not from higher levels. You must see that none of this humanity to suffer for food, shelter, cloths and medicines.",
            "Don’t put rules in the worship, in which case, the mind having inherent free nature revolts and drags you to the other side. Do worship with full freedom of mind. Don’t fix place and time-span for worship. Let it be any place and the time span shall be as long as the free mind follows it. The best worship is to get inspired by the divine personality of God in devoted discussions with limited number of devotees (Satsanga)",
            "Propagation of true spiritual knowledge is urgent need of this hour. Devotion is tremendous, service is marvellous and sacrifice is excellent. These three are increasing day by day. But, none of these three is based on true love to God in which aspiration for any fruit is absent! What is needed is the true understanding of the right direction in spiritual line. Hence, participate in propagation of this true spiritual knowledge needed by every soul in humanity for right direction.",
            "Leave the illusion that you will do something in your old age in spiritual line. I truly tell you that you can’t do anything in your old age since you become unable to do even the least normal activities in your old age. I may give human rebirth to an ignorant soul, but, I will never give human rebirth to a soul, who neglects spiritual line even on knowing its value.",
            "A saint sacrifices everything and everybody for My sake. Radha sacrificed even her life on hearing My exit from this world. Radha is the top most saint. Radha means dhara (as per Varnavyatyaya), which means the continuous stream of love. Meera is the incarnation of Radha. Her heart is the real Sahya hill, which means firm like hill tolerating (Sahya) all obstructions. I live in such hearts, which are firm like hill and tolerate all My tests. Without understanding this truth, people are searching Me on a hill called ‘Sahya’.",
            "Energy and time are Goddess Parvati and God Shiva. Wealth and the knowledge are Goddess Lakshmi and God Narayana. Word and intelligence are Goddess Saraswati and God Brahma. When you use all these six faculties in the divine service of propagation of knowledge and devotion of God, you are doing the real worship of these three divine couples. Such dedication in six ways is the true worship of God Shanmukha (Six faced Lord) or God Subrahmanya.",
            "When you are always thinking about worldly affairs only, without thinking about God, you are almost an atheist in the disguise of a theist!",
            "Parabrahman invented the concept of Love and fell in Love. ",
            "If you give food, cloths, shelter and medicine (if required) to the needy, you will certainly reach the heaven. Apart from these, if you give spiritual knowledge, you will first go to heaven and from there you will go to the abode of the God. Without the above-mentioned basic needs, a soul cannot understand the spiritual knowledge. Heaven is the intermediate station in the journey to reach the abode of God.",
            "Jñāna and Bhakti are theoretical. Karma is practical, which is also called as Prapatti. Theory alone has no fruit, but, theory is the mother of practice. When practice is associated with theory, the sacrifice and service are devoid of selfishness. Hence, theory is essential as it generates practice and purifies it from selfishness.",
            "God and love are inseparable like sugar and sweetness. If one attains the love (devotion), God is spontaneously attained. Sage Vyasa got satisfaction of mind only after writing the Bhagavatam, which describes love of God and love towards God. Such love is attained from spiritual knowledge that gives various details of personality of God. ",
            "Never say that everything happens as per will of God. It is true, but the direction of everything is as per your will only, which decides the fruit. Freedom is given to soul to decide the direction of any action. Hence, you are responsible for everything as I am not responsible for any fruit attained by you. You should not throw responsibility on the cycle of deeds (karma) also.",
            "Knowledge is the degree. Devotion is the job obtained due to that degree. Service is the work done on the job. The salary is the grace of God. The salary is given for the work done on the job. Therefore the direct cause of the salary is only the service done by you.",
            "You must always analyse food you take regarding its effects on your body. The food also affects your mind and intelligence. Food is the source of good health as well as disease. The qualities of food and its quantity should be always analysed. You take food through your mouth and similarly you hear the sentences through your ears. You must analyse the quality and quantity of speech grasped by your ears. Both these decide your spiritual future.",
            "God does not require anything from you except your real love, which can be proved through practice alone. Service and sacrifice in practice are only considered as practical proof for your real devotion. The practical service and sacrifice are required as proof only and God really does not need your service or sacrifice. If the proof is absent the real love and false love look alike and can’t be discriminated.",
            "Your theoretical devotion should be without aspiration for any fruit in return. Your practical devotion is a must to prove your theoretical devotion. There should be no lagging behind in theory as well as in practice. God always tests you in that one thing, which can’t be sacrificed by you. A sacrifice should be full because you must realise that God is not in need of any sacrifice from you for His personal purpose. ",
            "Practical sacrifice is only to test the quality and quantity of your theoretical devotion. Welfare of the world is in the aim of God better than yourself because world is created and maintained by God only.",
            "You think that a specific area on this earth is especially pious because a deserving sage has seen Me in that area. I surely tell you that there is no specialty in that area to treat it as very pious place to be visited as pilgrimage. I appeared in that area because the deserving sage was living in that area. You can attach importance to Me and that sage but not to that are.",
            "Saraswati is praising Me through sweet words. Lakshmi is serving Me by pressing My feet with her hands. Parvati is doing penance through concentrated mind. All these three are various forms of My wife called as Madhumati or Anagha. My wife gives coffee and Tiffin (worldly boons) to My devotee on arrival to My place. She does so on My instruction only. If you ask her for some money (miraculous powers), she advises you ask Me. Coffee, Tiffin and money are fundamentally My property only. Hence, you concentrate on Me only.",
            "Even if you control your mind, the senses drag the mind towards worldly items. The senses are like bottles of wine that drag your mind. If you are controlled by your senses, it is impossible to reach Me. In spite of this, if you think that you can reach Me, it is only deceiving yourself. Don’t postpone spiritual effort for tomorrow. There is no tomorrow. Only today is the truth. Yesterday will not come back. Today, now itself, get yourself attached to Me.",
            "Durga means the palace surrounded by big compound-wall with closed gates. People living in such palace have full protection. Similarly, devotees living in Me get full protection here as well as there. The protection is given for the real love of devotee. Today is the day on which I destroyed all the evil forces of devils and demons. I suppressed king Bali with My foot since he prayed Me to keep My foot on his head. King Bali represents ego. If you surrender to My feet, I will suppress it down forever so that it will not come up again.",
            "\"Love ONLY God,\n" +
                    "Serve ONLY God.\n" +
                    "(eka-bhaktir viśhiṣhyate – Gita)\"",
            "A real theist always proceeds in the path of real love to God aspiring no fruit in return and hence, such a devotee will never put his eye on miracles that increase the selfishness of the devotee to exploit God for personal worldly benefits. The interest on miraculous powers increases the selfishness of a devotee, which is a real hinderance in progressing spiritually towards God. These miracles mislead the devotee from the correct path.",
            "Hanuman used Himself as a servant in the service of Lord Rama and the benefit of all His service went to the Lord only by getting back Sita. Hanuman is not benefited in any way since He did all the service without aspiration of any personal fruit in return. Hence, Hanuman is worshipped as God and several temples for Hanuman are seen.",
            "Some devotees try to achieve the miraculous powers utilizing the grace of God. Only God has the capability of handling these miraculous powers just like the ring master in the circus has the special talent to control the lions. Any devotee other than God cannot control the miraculous powers in a balanced way and is destroyed by these powers in no time just like any other ordinary human being trying to control the lions in the circus will be killed and eaten away in no time! ",
            "God has created this world like an industrialist establishing an industry. It is quite natural that the industrialist always expects that his industry must run peacefully and similarly, God expects that His creation must run on peaceful lines."
